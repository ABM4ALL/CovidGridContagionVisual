# README

This CovidGridContagionVisual model [[doc](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_contagion_visual.html)] 
is built on top of the [CovidContagion](https://github.com/ABM4ALL/CovidContagion) 
model to show how the ``Visualizer`` and ``MelodieStudio`` modules can be implemented.
If you haven't, we will strongly suggest to read the documentation of the
[CovidContagion](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/tutorial.html) and the 
[CovidGridContagion](https://abm4all.github.io/Melodie/html/gallery/covid_grid_contagion.html) models first.
